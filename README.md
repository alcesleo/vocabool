## Tech

- django
    - jstemplates
    - djangorestframework
    -

## Branches???

- `master` is the working code in its original form, best place to look at working code
- `dev` development branch, might have a bunch of unpolished and untested features
- `deploy` has all dependencies already added, **never** merge from this branch

## Deploy

PythonAnywhere wsgi.py

## API:s

- Yandex Translate
- Google Dictionary

### Potential

- Wiktionary
    - Sadly, **extremely** messy output, very difficult to make sense of and
    would take a lot of work to get the short concise definitions I'm looking for
- Wordnik
    - Looks very nice, if I was only interested in English definitions I would
    probably have gone for this one
- Yandex seems to have a decent dictionary API as well.
