## Credits

During this project I have worked with a bunch of **awesome** framewoks/services that
have seriously impressed me, and make me proud to be a human being.

-   Backend is driven by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [DRF](http://django-rest-framework.org/)
-   Frontend is driven by [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
    and of course [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
-   Design is based on [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
-   Definitions are from [Wiktionary](http://www.wiktionary.org/)
    and translations are from [Yandex Translate](http://translate.yandex.com/)

Minor:

- flags from <http://flag-sprites.com/>
- caching django compressor
- django-registration login outside the SPA
